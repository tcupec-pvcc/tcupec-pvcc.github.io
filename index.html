        <h2>What is a Representative?</h2>
            <p>A <a href= "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/representative"><u>Representative</u></a>, also known as a congressman or congresswoman, is an elected official to a two-year term serving the people of a specific congressional district.

        <h2>House of Representatives</h2>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/United_States_House_of_Representatives_2015.svg"/> 
        <p>The House of Representatives is made up of 435 elected members, divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. Along with this is 6 non-voting representatives,
            for the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

        <p>The House has different committees that each have different legislative jurisdictions. Each of these committees considers bills and issues
            and recommends items for consideration by the House. Committees also have the responsibility to oversee and monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdiction.
            These committees are not set in stone and can change in number and shape with each new Congress for efficient consideration of legislation.
            Committees focus on specific policy areas, whereas the subcommittees take on more specialized areas. There are currently 20 major standing committees with 104 subcommittees.

    <p>The Committee of the Whole House is a committee where all representatives meet in the House Chamber for the consideration of measures from the Union calendar.
        Before members are assigned to committees, each committee’s size, and the proportion of Republicans to Democrats must be decided by the party leaders. The total number of committee slots allotted
        to each party is approximately the same as the ratio between majority party and minority party members in the full chamber.</p>

    <p>The first step in the legislative process is the introduction of a bill to Congress. The bill can be written by anyone but only members of Congress can introduce legislation. The bill
        is first considered in the subcommittees of the House, where it may be accepted, amended, or rejected. If the members of the subcommittee agree to move the bill forward it will be given to the
        full committee. The process is then repeated, during which the committees and subcommittees call hearings to investigate the bills’ pros and cons. During this time, they invite experts, advocates, and opponents to come
        before the committees and provide a testimony. If the full committee approves the bill, it is then reported to the entire floor of the House or Senate and the majority party leader decides when to place the bill on the calendar for consideration.
        Unless a bill is a pressing matter bills could wait for months or never be scheduled on the calendar at all.</p>

        <p>Whether a representative is working on Capitol Hill or in his / her congressional district, their schedule stays extremely busy. Often starting early in the morning with topical briefings and then moving quickly among caucus and committee meetings
            and hearings. They will vote on bills, speak with constituents and other groups, review constituent mail, press clips and various reports. With their work often going into the evening with receptions or fundraising events.</p>
